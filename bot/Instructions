Before using the bot, create two more folders in the same folder where main.py is located, a "video" and "audio" folder.
After that, enter in the command line: pip install telebot pytube moviepy pathlib subprocess psutil
If it gives you an error, try running this command first: apt install python3-pip
Then try again.
and when everything is installed, run: python3 autostart.py
